### 👨‍💻 Backend Developer | API Architect | DevOps Enthusiast

Hi!! 🙋‍♂️ I'm a backend-focused developer who loves building **scalable, fault-tolerant systems**, crafting **battle-tested RESTful and GraphQL APIs**, and optimizing data flows like a digital locksmith.  

I move fast, break things intentionally, then rebuild them better. My toolkit is tuned for performance, clean architecture, and automation at scale. 🛠️  

> I don’t just write code — I debug infrastructure, script efficiency, and architect resilience.
